Comparing Deep Learning Approaches for Medical Image Analysis

This project explores how different deep learning architectures can be used for medical image classification (e.g., brain tumour detection). We will compare traditional CNNs with state-of-the-art models such as Vision Transformers, Variational Autoencoders, and/or leading pre-trained models. Our goal is to understand the trade-offs between these methods (e.g., accuracy, computational efficiency).
